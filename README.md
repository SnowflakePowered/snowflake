Snowflake is a powerful, extensible emulator frontend that works out-of-the-box, built using bleeding edge techonogies on the web and desktop.


Features
--------
Snowflake provides a powerful set of APIs for us to build a frontend that just works, no matter what it looks like, on Windows, Linux and OSX*. Using powerful but moddable HTML5 and Javascript to build our user interface and a C# API that's easy to work with, Snowflake allows for powerful integration with currently existing emulators, and a wealth of custom features just a click away.

_*Linux through Mono or CoreCLR support currently planned. OSX support to be evaluated after_

Documentation
-------------
Preliminary technical documentation is available [here](http://snowflakepowe.red/doc/html/). As we go further along in Snowflake's development, design documents will become available.

Contributing
------------
Please feel free to explore the current API, please be aware that Snowflake is still pre-release software and may change at any time. We're also in need of code coverage so if you have some free time, feel free to write some unit tests for Snowflake. Remember to read the contribution guildelines before filing a pull request.

What's Possible?
----------------
Anything that's possible to do in HTML5 will be possible on Snowflake. Snowflakes initial interface will be done in Material Design, for a beautiful looking window to your games. (Actual WIP screenshot)
