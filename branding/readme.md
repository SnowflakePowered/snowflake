![badge-snowflake]

The badge logo is provided in three variants: *gradient*, *white*, and *black* in a variety of different sizes. The variant preferred and displayed above is the *gradient* variant.

#### Description
The badge logo is a figure of 6 three fingered dendrites equally spaced around a ring forming a snowflake-like figure, superimposed on a hexagon that matches the closest polygonal outline of the snowflake. The *gradient* variant has the hexagon a 75 degree even linear gradient from *Periwinkle* to *Lilac*, such that the very top of the logo is coloured *Periwinkle*, and the bottom of the logo is coloured *Lilac*. 

#### Guidelines

* **DO** Use the *gradient* variant whenever possible.
* **DO** Use the *white* variant if a colour-neutral design is required.
* **DO** Recolor the logo in a **solid** colour if absolutely necessary.
* **DO NOT** Use the *black* varieat except against stark white (`#fff`). The *gradient* variant is preferred against stark white as well.
* **DO NOT** Apply any gradient besides the provided *gradient* variant.
* **DO NOT** Display the logo in a resolution less than 65px in any variant except the *gradient* variant.
* **DO NOT** Add drop shadows or special effects to the logo.
* **DO NOT** Invert the logo so the snowflake is not enclosed in its hexagon.
* **DO NOT** Enclose the logo in another shape.

### The *Banner Logo*

### The *Badge Logo*
![badge-hydrogen]

The badge logo is provided in three variants: *color*, *white*, and *black* in a variety of different sizes. The variant preferred and displayed above is the *color* variant.

#### Description
The badge logo is a figure of a classical depiction of a hydrogen atom superimposed on a sheet of material. The nucleus of the atom is at the center with an electron at a 45 degree angle from the first quadrant to the nucleus at a distance 1.5 the radius of the nucleus, with a 4pt ring intersecting with the electron surrounding the nucleus. On the *color* variant, the nucleus, ring, and electron are coloured with a 75 degree even linear gradient from *Aster* to *Cyan* such that the electron is wholly coloured cyan. The sheet on which the atom is superimposed is coloured with a 90 degree even linear gradient such that the top of the sheet is *Off-white*, while the bottom of the sheet is *Light Gray*. The sheet has a bottom 1px shaded edge beginning from 2/3rds down the circle, smoothly darkening reaching a maximum of about 30% darkness.

#### Guidelines

* **DO** Use the *color* variant whenever possible.
* **DO** Use the *white* variant if a colour-neutral design is required.
